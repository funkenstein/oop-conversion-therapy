# OOP Conversion Therapy

Did your genetics curse you with the inability to write reasonable software? Did
your university cripple your critical thinking abilities? Were you indoctrinated
with a disastrous programming paradigm from the outset of your career?

Have no fear! This collection of resources can redeem your soul and teach you
how to write real software.

(Although some of the resources mention specific languages or programming
paradigms, they were all selected on the basis of being applicable to software
in general.)
